   * `presence`, P§6 — the first that applies: (1) the subject's own devices (every audience), (2) a presented
   * grant (its `presence_audience`), (3) a capability issued for the target, (4) the authority's policy (its
   * audience); with no policy, only (1)–(3) admit. A `subscribe` naming only `publication` keeps the publication
   * rules: a policy (public or allow) or a capability, under a policy.
   * Spec: §9.3 (spec-gap 149 (a)) — a target is "seen" when a policy or an issued capability names it, a device of it
   * has bound here, or it is an identity of `context.identities` (the identities the authority knows its devices by);
   * a publication target must also be published.
   * Impl: a `subscribe` naming `presence` together with other events is admitted by the presence rules.
