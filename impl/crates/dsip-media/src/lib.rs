//! `dsip-media` — the native media endpoint (Phase 2): WebRTC DTLS-SRTP audio.
//!
//! Spec: sections owned by this crate — §14.1 (no media without a signed
//! answer: a leg only starts sending once the DSIP session is ACTIVE), §16.3
//! (SDP as a transport binding object — spec-gap 16), §12.12 (ICE candidates
//! ride in signed `info` after ACTIVE; gathered candidates are handed to the
//! host as they appear so it can buffer them), §14.4 (screening: a `recvonly`
//! leg exposes no local media), §17.1 (Opus audio). The normative shapes are
//! in the WebRTC Media Binding draft (`v0.7/dsip-webrtc-media-binding-v0.7-draft.md`).
//!
//! Impl: two interchangeable backends behind one [`MediaLeg`] surface, chosen
//! at runtime by [`Backend`]; both are compiled in by default:
//! - `forge` (feature; the default backend) — forge-media's `forge-webrtc` 0.3
//!   endpoint peer connection, the project's own stack
//!   (`impl/docs/forge-media-plan.md`);
//! - `webrtc-rs` (feature) — plan §7's named fallback, kept compiled in as the
//!   reference peer: three forge interop bugs were only visible against it.
//!
//! The agent and CLI never see which backend is in use; a cross-backend test
//! (`tests/cross_backend.rs`) proves a forge leg and a webrtc-rs leg exchange
//! SRTP. No sound card is used: the source is a generated tone or an Ogg/Opus
//! file and inbound audio is recorded to Ogg, which proves the DTLS-SRTP path
//! end to end headlessly.
